#Diamond Price Prediction!

Welcome to this awesome project!

##This project is focused in the next steps:

- We dowloaded a dataset from Kaggle. This dataset is about the price of diamonds given some measurements and characteristics.

- The dataset is divided in two subsets. The first one is the train.csv, that we used to train our models and predict the first prices. Then, we loaded the test.csv that has all the colums but the "price" one, so we predicted the prices also and appended the predicted price to the dataset.

- We made some adjustments to the dataset in order to allow our regression models to analyze it and train itselves (encoded our string columns and converted the to integers). With all this data and some time spent training the model, we were able to predict the prices of the diamonds and score a top 3 in the Kaggle competition where we got this dataset from!

- Finally, we only took the "id" column and the "price" one, and created some output dataframes to submit in the Kaggle competition.

###The Algorithms used for this project are the following ones:

- Simple Linear regression

- Binary tree Algorithm

- Random Forest regression Algorithm

And our shinning star!

- The Gradient Boosting Algorithm!

The last one is the one which we improved with some tweakings and the one that got us to the top 3 of this competition!
